#arte-lib

A collection of libraries usefull to multiple arte project components (e.g., an arte-data server, or a serialization format for something not directly related to the ephys data).

The scope is pretty limited, because everything modeling the ephys should be in [tetrode-ephys](https://github.com/imalsogreg/arte-ephys/tree/master/tetrode-ephys) or [tetrode-graphics](https://github.com/imalsogreg/arte-ephys/tree/master/tetrode-graphics)
